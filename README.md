Fast and direct photosynthesis measurements utilizing a CO₂‐sensitive colourimetric dye

This repository contains the designs, code and data for my bachelor thesis research submitted to Wageningen University & Research, in collaboration with Jan Ingenhousz Institute on 4th July 2025. The project investigates the feasibility of utilizing CO2-sensitive
dye (ortho-cresolphthalein), developed by Mills group at Queen’s university Belfast, for carbon assimilation measurements and its response to environmental conditions through experiments targeted to work with the natural physiological processes of a leaf.

Measuring photosynthesis with the CO2-sensitive dye will allow tracking of much faster
change in direct proximity to the leaf which ultimately would translate in high-throughput
measurements. High throughput carbon assimilation measurements would open the possibility of selecting for those photosynthetic traits. Within plant breeding programs this would allow selection on potential yield gains currently remaining unharnessed.
